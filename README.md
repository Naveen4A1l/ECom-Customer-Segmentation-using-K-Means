Project Title
ECom Customer Segmentation using K-Means

Overview
E-commerce companies deal with large volumes of customer data. This project segments customers into distinct groups based on their behavior, enabling businesses to:

Identify high-value customers.
Personalize marketing efforts.
Optimize customer retention strategies.
Features
Data preprocessing and normalization.
Implementation of the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Application of K-Means Clustering for customer segmentation.
Visualization of clusters using 2D and 3D plots for insights..
Dataset
The dataset used includes the following features:

CustomerID
Age
Gender
Annual Income
Spending Score
Methodology
Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values.
Standardizing numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzing patterns in the dataset.
Visualizing customer demographics and spending behavior.
Optimal Cluster Selection
Using the Elbow Method by plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters.
Clustering
Applying the K-Means algorithm to segment the customers.

Cluster Analysis
Interpreting and visualizing clusters for actionable insights.
Technologies Used
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

Python (>=3.7)
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Installation
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/Naveen4A1l/ECom-Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means cd ecom-customer-segmentation

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook ECom_Customer_Segmentation.ipynb

Follow the steps in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and execute the clustering algorithm.

Modify the notebook to use your dataset and adjust parameters as needed.

Results
The project provides:

Optimal cluster count using the Elbow Method.
Customer clusters visualized in 2D/3D space.
Insights into customer segments such as high spenders, low-income groups, or potential loyal customers.
